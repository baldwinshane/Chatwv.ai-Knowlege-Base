## Content Guidelines
To ensure consistency and quality, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### General Rules
- **Relevance**: Contributions should focus on West Virginia’s history, culture, recreational activities, or specific topics like Sissonville, Native American history, or natural resources (e.g., ginseng, yellowroot).
- **Accuracy**: Verify facts using credible sources (e.g., West Virginia State Archives, wvencyclopedia.org, National Park Service). Cite sources in your content.
- **Clarity**: Write in clear, concise language suitable for a general audience.
- **Neutrality**: Maintain a neutral tone, avoiding personal opinions or biased language.
- **Respect**: Be respectful of West Virginia’s diverse communities and cultural heritage.

### Content Types
You can contribute in two formats:
1. **Narrative Knowledge Base Entries** (Markdown files):
   - Use for detailed explanations, such as historical events (e.g., Battle of Scary Creek), cultural descriptions (e.g., Appalachian music), or guides (e.g., how to find arrowheads in Jackson County).
   - Structure with headers, paragraphs, and lists for readability.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     # Battle of Scary Creek
     ## Date and Location
     - **Date**: July 17, 1861
     - **Location**: Near Nitro, Putnam County, West Virginia
     ## Context
     The Battle of Scary Creek was a minor engagement during the Civil War...
     ## Sources
     - West Virginia Encyclopedia: [link]
     ```

2. **Structured Datasets** (CSV, JSON, or YAML files):
   - Use for lists or tabular data, such as ATV trails, camping spots, or archaeological sites.
   - Ensure consistent formatting (e.g., column headers in CSV, proper key-value pairs in JSON).
   - Example (CSV for fishing spots):
     ```csv
     Name,Location,FishSpecies,AccessType
     Plum Orchard Lake,Oak Hill,Trout;Bass,Paid
     Kanawha River,Sissonville,Bass;Catfish,Public
     ```

  - Use `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings, etc.
  - Use bullet points (`-`) or numbered lists for clarity.
  - Include sources at the end of narrative entries.
- **Datasets**:
  - CSV: Use commas as delimiters, include headers, avoid special characters in values.
  - JSON/YAML: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for YAML, 2 or 4 for JSON).
- **File Naming**:
  - Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `battle-scary-creek.md`, `atv-trails.csv`).
  - Reflect the content in the file name (e.g., `sissonville-strip-mines.md`).
